				<h4>
					Introduction
				</h4>
				<p>
					This mod is a collection of tweaks, fixes and/or cheats. All of these were written by me (with the usual file which was borrowed from some other mod, as duly noted in the 'thanks' section), except for 'WSPatch for all', the bulk of which was coded by Taimon, and 'Party members can facestab too', the bulk of which was coded by Ascension64.

				<h4>
					Compatibility notes
				</h4>
				<p>
				This mod should be installed as late as possible, in particular after any mod that adds new spells (or items), mods that add smarter fights, or mods that add RealGlobalSetTimer() actions (EG romances).
				<br>All these component should install correctly and work over SoA only, but it's untested. Most of these components should also work correctly over Tutu, but that's untested too. (Some of these have no meaning for Tutu, since all the spells/abilities they tweak are of too high level, for example the Nature's Beauty, Imprisonment and/or Wish components).
				<br>All these component are compatible with the Enhanced Edition of both BG1 (including the Siege of Dragonspear expansion) and BG2, as well as the Enhanced Edition Trilogy.

				<h4>
					Installation
				</h4>
				
				<h5><strong>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG</h5>
				<p>Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must  run a program called <a href="https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/50441/modmerge-merge-your-steam-gog-zip-based-dlc-into-something-weidu-nearinfinity-dltcep-can-use/p1">Modmerge</a> on your SoD installation  before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod. </p>
				
				<h5>
					Windows
				</h5>
				<p>
					The Bigg Tweak Pack is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen.
			<br>
			<br>Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using WinRAR. If properly extracted, you should have a tb#tweaks folder, and Setup-tb#tweaks.exe in your BG2 folder. To install, simply double-click Setup-tb#tweak.exe and follow the instructions on screen.
			<br>
			<br>Please re-run Setup-tb#tweak.exe in your BG2 folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.
		</p>

				<h5>
				Macintosh
				</h5>
				<p>
			<i>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the new version. Please note that this mod is incompatible with Mod Organizer. </i> The Bigg Tweak Pack is packaged and installed with WeiDU. To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your BG2 folder. If properly extracted, you should have a tb#tweaks folder, Setup-tb#tweaks, and Setup-tb#tweaks.command in your BG2 folder. To install, simply double-click Setup-tb#tweaks.command and follow the instructions on screen.
				</p>

		<h5>
		Linux
		</h5>
		<p>
		Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from
		<a href="http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg">weidu.org</a> and extract (at least)
		the WeiDU, weinstall and tolower executables in a $PATH directory (E.G.
		/usr/bin).
		<br>Following that, open a terminal, cd to your BG2 installation directory,
	run `tolower' and answer Y to both queries.
		<br><span class='small'>
		You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it
		once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered,
	so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either
		if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lower cased file
		name.
		<br>If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe
		bet.
		</span>
		<br>After that, run 'weinstall tb#tweaks' from your BG2
		installation directory to install or uninstall the mod.

				</div>
				</p>

				<a name="nat" id="Nature's Beauty"></a>
				<h5>
					Nature's Beauty Tweak
				</h5>
				<p>
				<div class="divimp">
					With this component installed, the blinding effect in the Nature's Beauty tweak is reduced to 8 hours of duration. This way you'll be able to rest it off.
				</div>
				</p>

				<a name="imp" id="Imprisonment Fix"></a>
				<h5>
					Imprisonment Fix
				</h5>
				<p>
				<div class="divimp">
					This component fixes the Imprisonment effect, so that it won't terminate the game if cast on Player1, doesn't terminate romances, doesn't cause random bugs with summons, and finally you can't use it for infinite experience points. Differently from other fixes circulating, this one also fixes the Protection from Imprisonment effect, and fixes the instances of these occuring in mods.
				</div>
				</p>

				<a name="pet" id="Petrification Fix"></a>
				<h5>
					Petrification Fix
				</h5>
				<p>
				<div class="divimp">
					This component fixes the Flesh to Stone effect, so that it won't terminate the game if cast on Player1, doesn't terminate romances, doesn't cause random bugs with summons, and finally you can't use it for infinite experience points. It also fixes the Protection from Petrification and the Stone to Flesh effects, and fixes the instances of these occuring in mods.
				</div>
				</p>

				<a name="dro" id="Drop Weapons in Panic Removal"></a>
				<h5>
					Drop Weapons in Panic Removal
				</h5>
				<p>
				<div class="divimp">
					This component removes the Drop Weapons in Panic effect from the game.
				</div>
				</p>

				<a name="wi1" id="Wishes Fixes"></a>
				<h5>
					Unlimited Limited Wish & Wish
				</h5>
				<p>
				<div class="divimp">
					This component is deprecated. Use the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> instead.
				</div>
				</p>

				<a name="wi2" id="Wishes cheats"></a>
				<h5>
					Cheesier Limited Wish & Wish group
				</h5>
				<p>
				<div class="divimp">
				These are two components, which add cheese possibilities to the two Wish spells:
				<br>the Covenient Wish lets you get all choices from Wish if you are not in battle, while not affecting the Limited Wish spell.
				<br>the Cheesy Wish &amp; Limited Wish component lets you get all choices from both Wish and Limited Wish, while one-time wishes remain such.
				<br>
				<br>If you have only SoA, you can only install the Cheesy Limited Wish part.
				</div>
				</p>

				<a name="dif" id="Improved Difficulty System"></a>
				<h5>
					Improved Difficulty System
				</h5>
				<p>
				<div class="divimp">
				<em>This component has no effect on an unmodded game, it only makes sense with mods that add smarter enemies according to the difficulty level (EG Ding0's Quest Pack, Oversight).</em>
				<br>This component (based on an idea originally contained in the RtW mod) allows you to set the difficulty level to be different from the one set in the slider. This allows you to get more intelligent enemies, while not getting 200% damage.
				<br>The difficulty is set via a dialogue with Ggib Eht; if you later want to change your difficulty level, you can either activate the AI, choose your character, and press the 'k' key, or use directly the "RTWMyDifficulty","Global" variable (1=easiest, 5=hardest).
				<br>
				<br>If you have the Enhanced Edition of either BG1 or BG2 (including Siege of Dragonspear DLC, or the Enhanced Edition Trilogy), Story Mode and Legacy of Bhaal will <b>not</b> be adjusted.
				</div>
				</p>

				<a name="fas" id="Faster Romances"></a>
				<h5>
					Faster Romances
				</h5>
				<p>
				<div class="divimp">
				This component will make romances (and other things that are regulated RealGlobalTimer() ) be faster; this isn't a linear decrement (EG reduce timers by 30% or 50%), it uses instead non-obvious mathematical formulas (a rational constant multiplied for a rational power of the original timer, or the original timer if lower) to make sure that the effect is less relevant on short timers, while being sensible on longer timers. For example, on the Medium setting a timer of half an hour (wall clock) is reduced to 25 minutes, while a time of 6 hours (wall clock) is reduced to only 2 hours.
				</div>
				</p>

				<a name="req" id="No Item Requirements"></a>
				<h5>
					No Item Requirements
				</h5>
				<p>
				<div class="divimp">
					This component will remove all statistic requirements from items, so that you can wear full plate with 1 strenght, use a scroll with 1 int, et cetera. While this classifies as a cheat, it removes some of the frustration that can arise with mods that enhance those restrictions (like Ashes of Embers).
				</div>
				</p>
				
				<a name="wsp" id="WSPatck for all"></a>
				<h5>
					WSPATCK for all
				</h5>
				<p>
				<div class="divimp">
					This component will give attack per round bonuses to all characters according to WSPATCK.2da.
          You can choose to do this in the following manners:
          <ul><li>"Always": full bonuses for all characters (overpowered)</li>
          <li>"Only for ** and up": one ApR for all non-specialized characters, full bonuses for those at least
          specialized (making specialization worthwhile for swashbucklers and nerfing not specialized warriors).</li>
          <li>"Everybody gets ApR from proficiency, only Warriors from level": Fighters/Rangers/Paladins/Barbarians get
          half an attack per round at 7<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> level; everybody gets half an attack if Specialized
          and (if one of the "True Grandmastery" patches are installed) an additional attack if Grand Master.</li>
					<br />
					This component was largely coded by Taimon and recoded by Ascension64; it and automatically includes
          <a href="http://bit.ly/i8awTx">Ascension64's TobEx</a>, and as such will not
          work on OSX (and might or might not work on Linux).

				</div>
				</p>
				
				<a name="s3s" id="3rd edition style strength"></a>
				<h5>
					3rd Edition Style Strength
				</h5>
				<p>
				<div class="divimp">
					This component alters the Strength tables so that the effects of mid-range values of strength are now different: for example, 8 Strength gets -1 thac0, -1 damage, whereas 14 gets you +2/+2. Previously both cases would receive +0/+0.
					<br /><br />Thac0 is computed with the real 3rd edition rules (thac0 bonus = (str - 10) / 2), whereas the other Strength bonuses (damage bonus, bend bars/lift gates, weight allowance) use different rules. In the case of damage, the formula is similar (damage bonus = (str - 9) / 2); the value is greater because that's how it's in 2nd edition, and to ensure that advancing to an odd value is useful. The formulas used for BBLG and weight allowance are too complicated for this document - they were designed with the goal to behave similarly to the 2nd edition tables, but smoothening them around the 18-19 gap caused by extraordinary strength. If you want more in-depth info, the file tb#tweaks/doc/strength/strength.pdf offers tables and graphs, and the file tb#tweaks/lib/3rd_ed_str.tpa contains a discussion.
					<br /><br />As an additional consequence, exceptional strength is irrilevant (even if still shown) and going from 18 to 19 isn't now black-and-white change.
					
				</div>
				</p>
				
				<a name="d3s" id="3rd edition style dexterity"></a>
				<h5>
					3rd Edition Style Dexterity
				</h5>
				<p>
				<div class="divimp">
					This component alters the Dexterity tables so that the effects of mid-range values of dexterity are now different: for example, 8 dexterity gets you -1 AC, whereas 14 gets you +2. Previously both cases would receive +0.
					<br /><br />AC bonuses are computed with the real 3rd edition rules (bonus = (dex - 10) / 2), whereas reaction bonus, ranged thac0 bonus and Save vs. Breath bonus is slightly lower (bonus = (dex - 11) / 2)), to ensure that advancing to an odd value is useful.
					
				</div>
				</p>
				
				<a name="co3" id="3rd edition style constitution"></a>
				<h5>
					3rd Edition Style Constitution
				</h5>
				<p>
				<div class="divimp">
					This component alters the Constitution tables so that the effects of mid-range values of constitution are now different: for example, 8 constitution gets you -1 HP per level, whereas 14 gets you +2. Previously both cases would receive +0.
					<br /><br />Bonuses to hit points and fatigue are computed with the real 3rd edition rules (bonus = (con - 10) / 2), whereas Save vs. Poison/Hold/Death is slightly lower (bonus = (con - 11) / 2). Regeneration rate and minimum dice are untouched.
					<br /><br />As an additional consequence, all classes would benefit from a constitution over 16. Previously, only fighters/rangers/paladins would.
					
				</div>
				</p>

				<a name="wi3" id="3rd edition style wisdom"></a>
				<h5>
					3rd Edition Style Wisdom
				</h5>
				<p>
				<div class="divimp">
					This component alters the Wisdom tables so you can get a bonus to Save vs. Spell, as you would in 3rd edition: bonus = (wis - 10) / 2)
					
				</div>
				</p>				
				<a name="ch3" id="3rd edition style charisma"></a>
				<h5>
					3rd Edition Style Charisma
				</h5>
				<p>
				<div class="divimp">
					This component alters the Charisma tables so that the effects of mid-range values of charisma are now different.
					<br /><br />Only store discounts are altered. (discount = max(5 * (cha - 10) / 2),0).
					
				</div>
				</p>
				
				<a name="dme" id="druids can wear metal"></a>
				<h5>
					Druids can Wear Metal
				</h5>
				<p>
				<div class="divimp">
					This component allows druids to wear helmets, and fighter/druids to wear metal armor. This does nothing in the standard game, but will revert changes by Divine Remix and/or Item Revision.
					
				</div>

          This component is coded via (and automatically includes)          
          <a href="http://bit.ly/i8awTx">Ascension64's TobEx</a>, and as such will not
          work on OSX (and might or might not work on Linux).
          <br /><br />
		  <b>This component is not yet compatible with the Enhanced Edition engines, because of the following limitations:
		  <li>Sorcerors can use the Spellbook to both gain experience and learn the associated spell(s).</li>
		  <li>Specialist mages can use the Spellbook to learn spells from their forbidden school(s).</li>
		  <li>Intelligence limits to the number of spells a character can learn, as well as the chance of failing to do so, aren't applied.</li>
		  <li>Thieves who have taken the Use Any Item can use the Spellbooks to learn spells and gain experience (even if they can't benefit from the spells they learned).</li>
          <br /><br />
          With this component, enemy mages have a chance of dropping a spellbook containing
          some of their memorized Wizard spells. The chances of actually doing so are random:
          you can choose (indipendently) that mages have a 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% chance of
          dropping their spellbooks, which have a 25%, 50, 75% or 100% chance of containing
          any of the memorized spells. Starting a new game won't re-randomise the items,
          reinstalling the component will.
          <br><br>
          Additionally, this component creates a cheat spellbook that contains ALL spells
          available to players (but still respects the learning rules about forbidden
          schools et cetera). The spellbook isn't normally available, but can easily be
          added with the CLUAConsole or a save game editor; the file name is tb#tspel.itm.
          <br><br>
          After using the spellbook it is destroyed; spell learning observes the usual rules
          regarding chance to learn, opposition schools, etc. An unfixable fact is that Sorcerors
          can use the book (destroying it); however, they won't learn the spells, so you're
          wasting the spellbook if you attempt to do so.
          <br><br>
          It is recommended (but not required) to install SCS or SCSII to ensure that spellbooks
          actually match what the mages do in-game; otherwise, many enemy mages (both vanilla and
          from most other difficulty-enhancing mods) <b>WILL</b> have spells in their spellbooks that
          they would never cast, and vice versa.
          <br><br>Even with SCS(II), some discrepancies are possible; a notable example is that
          spells cast via sequencers/contingencies aren't represented in spellbooks (this
          means that no spellbook will contain Mislead, Project Image or Simulacrum, and certain spells
          will be statistically under-represented compared to what the mages do); as an exception to
          that rule, all mages with access to eighth-level spells are assumed to have memorized
          Spell Immunity (which will thus be available even from mages that don't cast that spell).

					<span class="faq-a">A: Most components of this mod can be safely installed or uninstalled
          mid-game. Exceptions are as follows:
          <ul>
          <li>Imprisonment Fix: you can (un)install the component mid-game, but only
          if nobody is currently Imprisoned or protected from Imprisonment. Ditto for Petrification Fix.</li>
          <li>WSPATCK for all: the 'Everybody gets ApR from proficiency, only Warriors from level'
          option can't be safely installed / uninstalled mid-game.</li>
          <li>Mages drop spellbooks: the content of spellbooks can change after reinstalling; removing the 
          component mid-game will remove the spellbooks from your party.</li>
